# CurrencyMod

Welcome to the Currency Mod (Name WIP) github repoistory.

I've always wanted some sort of base economy for minecraft servers that is done through mods and not plugins. What I plan to have implemented by version 1.0.0 is the following:

-Bills (1,5,10,20,50,100)

-Vending Machine for trading

-Wallet
         
Now I know that doesn't sound like too much but much more is in the works after 1.0.0.

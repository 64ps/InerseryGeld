Squished:
-Vending machine says OUT when nothing in it
-Vending Machine stack placement fixed
-Vending Machine hopper interaction would put more items into machine then the stack limit would allow.
-other players can access vending machine buffer
-Removed ATM as it needs work (Will be re added in mod rewrite)
TODO;


-changing size of exchange machine deleted inventory  (Vending too??)
